#  DSA in Java – Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** practice repository!  
This repository contains 100+ Java-based solutions to coding problems that I’ve solved through consistent self-study and structured learning.

Each solution is written, tested, and organized topic-wise to help with interview preparation and strengthen core programming skills.
